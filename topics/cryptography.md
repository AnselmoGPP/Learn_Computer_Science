## Introduction

**Historical cryptography**: Art of writing and solving codes. It focused exclusively on ensuring secret communication between two parties sharing secret information in advance ("codes", private-key encryption).

**Modern cryptography**: Science about design, analysis, and implementation of mathematical techniques for securing information, systems, and computation against adversarial attack.

Cryptography is everywhere: passwords, password hashing, secure internet credit-card transactions, encrypted Wi-Fi, disk encryption, digitally signed software updates, bitcoin, etc.
