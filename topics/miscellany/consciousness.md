## Definitions

Consciousness is not easy to define. Some definitions are:

- Subjective experience.
- Consciousness is the sentience or awareness of internal or external existence. It involves any kind of experience, cognition (introspection, thought, imagination, volition), feeling or perception.
- Awareness or perception of:
  - an inward psychological or spiritual fact: intuitively perceived knowledge of something in oneâ€™s inner self
  - an inward awareness of an external object, state or fact
  - concern, interest
- State or activity characterized by sensation, emotion, volition or thought. Mind in the broadest sense. Something in nature that is distinguished from physical.
- Totality in psychology of sensations, perceptions, ideas, attitudes and feelings of which an individual or a group is aware at any given time or within a particular time span

As an example, when somebody gets hurt, his body responds executing some physical actions (usually with the aim of healing him and making him try to avoid to be hurt again) involving nerve impulses (electrical signals in the nervous system), brain rewiring, muscle contraction, cry, etc. All these responses are physical. However, something else is happening that no one can see: the feeling of pain. This cannot be seen, but only experienced by the subject who was harmed.


## Introduction

### Thomas Nagel

Reductionist theories doesn't explain consciousness. Perhaps a new theoretical form is needed.

Conscious experience is a widespread phenomenon. An organism has conscious experience at all means. There's something it is like to be that organism (subjective character of experience), which is not captured by the reductive analyses of the mental, making it not analysable. Every subjective phenomenon is connected with a single point of view, and it should be taken into account by a theory of consciousness.

Most bats perceive the external world primarily by sonar (echolocation). They emit high-frequency shrieks and detect their reflections from nearby objects. Their brains use this information to recognize their surroundings, similarly to how we use vision. While bat sonar is a form of perception, it's not similar to any of our senses, so it's not subjectively like anything we can experience or imagine.

I cannot imagine what it is like for a bat to be a bat because I'm restricted to the resources of my own mind, which are inadequate to the task. My experiences are not anything like a bat experiences. Similarly, the subjective character of the experience of a person deaf and blind from birth is not accessible to me, nor is mine to him. Some intelligent alien could not imagine what it is like to be human, and vice versa. 

There may exist facts that humans can never represent or comprehend (humanly inaccessible facts) because our structure doesn't permit us to operate with the required concepts. Reflection on what it is to be a bat seems to conclude that there are facts that don't consist in the truth of propositions expressible in human language.

The point of view is a type. Very similar individuals could understand the quality of the other's experience. But the more different they are, the less success to understand each other's experience.

Regarding the mind-body problem, if the facts of experience are accessible only from one point of view, then it's a mystery how the true character of experiences could be revealed in the physical operation of that organism (objective facts).

It may be easier than I thought to transcend inter-species barriers with the aid of imagination. For example, blind people can detect nearby objects by a form of sonar, using vocal clicks or taps of a cane. Perhaps they can imagine roughly what was like to possess the highly refined sonar of a bat. However, my point is not that we cannot know what it is like to be a bat. My point is that even to form a conception of what it is like to be a bat, one must take up the bat's point of view.

Though an alien could understand the rainbow, lighting, or clouds as physical phenomena, he would never be able to understand them as human concepts or their place in our phenomenal world.

In other areas the process of reduction moves towards greater objectivity, a more accurate view of real nature of things. It describes it not in terms of the impressions it makes on our senses, but in terms of its more general effects and of properties detectable by means other than human senses. The less it depends on a human viewpoint, the more objective is our description. Experience itself, however, doesn't fit here. However, we probably won't get closer to the real nature of human experience by leaving behind our human point of view and looking for a description in terms accessible to beings that could not imagine what it was like to be us.



## Questions

- Would I ask about consciousness if I am not conscious?
- Freedom (determinism, libertarianism, compatibilism) and consciousness are related?
- Sensations are unimaginable until we experience them (such as bat senses).
- Physics just makes predictions, but doesn't interpretate reality (including explaining consciousness).
  - Mathematically modelling a brain is possible? Is there randomness at quantum level that prevents it?
  - We interpretate the world at macro-level because we work with huge abstractions.
  - Is physics/maths all that there is?
  - Consciousness is not needed for the world to work as intended (apparently).
  - We cannot deduce consciousness from physical events. We cannot deduce gravity from physical events, but we assume our theory of gravity to be true because it makes excellent predictions. Thus, a theory of consciousness should predict, given a system, the type of consciousness associated.
- Different levels of consciousness.
- I think, thus I exist (Descartes). Thus, maybe consciousness is the most fundamental thing.
- Anything complex enough develops consciousness?
  - Can a complex automata that behave like people but experience nothing?
- Artificial neural networks
. We are preprogrammed



### Topics

Defining consciousness / experience
- Questions and purpose of the essay
- Why consciousness is difficult to define? And to provide evidence of it?
Humans are preprogrammed. Try to know about the world in order to make predictions.
We gather information from the world to predict better the outcomes of our actions.
- Consciousness is limited to a small piece of mind activity. Unconsciousness do the rest.
  - Consciousness is for non-routine/new/complex activities?
Neural networks do similar things, including abstractions.



### Do automatas wonder about consciousness?

Artificial neural networks create abstractions of the world. Let's consider a NN that models a real human brain. If NNs have no consciousness and humans do have, both systems would behave differently (NNs wouldn't wonder about consciousness). But if NNs have consciousness, they would behave like a human. 

Let's suppose consciousness is an illusion and humans have no consciousness. Let's call them NPCs (Non-Playable Characters). Would NPCs wonder about consciousness? Initially, we wouldn't expect them to do so. However, we would expect an NPC to ask questions about the world in order to understand it better and be able to navigate through it properly (i.e., be able to make better predictions about the world so it can navigate it better). But he himself is part of the world, so it will also ask questions about himself, and about how his own brain and body works.

Fact: Humans wonder about consciousness.

- If NPCs don't wonder about consciousness > They are behaving different than us because of the presence of consciousness. Thus, they don't have, and humans have.
- If NPCs wonder about consciousness > It might or might not be an illusion. And, if consciousness exists, any system has a degree of consciousness.










Or, alternatively, suposse that there is an automata that behaves in a way that makes it indistinguishable from a human being.


Let's consider an automata that behaves in a way that makes it indistinguishable from a human being. Let's suppose it has no consciousness, no first person experiences. Would it wonder about consciousness

- If he has no consciousness, we would expect him not to do so. In this case, we could say that consciousness is not an illusion because humans wonder about consciousness and automatas doesn't.

But we could expect him to ask questions about the world, in order to understand how it works, which would help him make better predictions about the world and about the outcomes of his own actions.


Would I ask about consciousness if I am not conscious?
