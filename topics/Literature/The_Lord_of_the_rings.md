### Ainulindalë (The music of the Ainur)

At the beginning, there was Eru. He created the Ainur. Eru proposed 3 themes and the ainur sang 3 songs based on them. However, Melkor, the most powerful and knowledgeable ainur, didn't stick too much to the themes and the songs ended up discorded. These songs went out into the Void and created a world globed amid the Void (Eä) (universe). Eru gave light to Eä by putting the Flame imperishable at the center of it. The ainur could see Eä and its history unfolded before them, and saw Elves and Men living in this world (Eru himself introduced them in the third theme). Some of the ainur loved what they saw and decided to descend to Eä to shape it for the good of the elves and men, while the others stayed with Eru in the Timeless halls. The descended ainur were called Valar. Some of them were Ulmo (water), Manwë (airs and winds), Aulë (the fabric of Earth) and Melkor (he secretly desired to subdue elves and men).

They descended at the beginning of times of Eä, when elves and men didn't still exist, and spent a long time preparing Eä for them. However, Melkor wanted to dominate Eä and the First battle of the Valar took place.

The elves call Eru, Ilúvatar, and both elves and men are called Children of Ilúvatar. The region of Eä where the Children are meant to live is Arda.

### Valaquenta (History of the Valar)

Ilúvatar created the Ainur, and they made great music before him. From this music, the world Eä began, and Iluvatar showed the ainur a vision of its history and beauty. Some ainur fell in love with Eä, so Ilúvatar made it real, set it amid the Void, and put the Secret fire (Flame imperishable) at its heart. Some ainur entered into Eä at the beginning of Time, and their task was to shape the world and make real what they saw in the vision. The descended ainur were called Valar by the elves, and Gods by men. The greatest valar were:

Valar kings (Valar):

- Manwë: Lord of Arda (specially, winds and clouds). King of Valars. Second most powerful valar. He understands most clearly Ilúvatar purposes.
- Ulmo: Lord of the waters. Third most powerful valar.
- Aulë: Smith and lord of crafts. Little less powerful than Ulmo.
- Oromë: Lord of forests. Hunter of monsters and fell beasts.
- Námo (Mandos): Master of spirits. Keeper of the Houses of the Dead, and summoner of the spirits of the slain. He knows all things that shall be, and saves only those that lie still in the freedom of Ilúvatar.
- Irmo (Lórien): Master of spirits. Master of visions and dreams.
- Tulkas: The greatest in strength and deeds of prowess. He enjoys wrestling and contests of strength. He came last to Arda to help in the first wars with Melkor.

Valar queens (Valier):

- Varda: Lady of the Stars. She knows all the regions of Eä. Spouse of Manwë.
- Yavanna: Queen of the Earth. Lover of all things that grow. Spouse of Aulë.
- Nienna: She has grief and mourns for every wound that Arda suffers by Melkor.
- Estë: Healer of hurts and of weariness. Spouse of Lórien.
- Vairë: Registers all things that have ever been, and saves them in the halls of Mandos. Spouse of Mandos.
- Vána: The Ever-young. Flowers spring and birds sing when she is close. Spouse of Örome. Sister of Yavanna.
- Nessa: Lithe and fleetfooted. Spouse of Tulkas. Sister of Örome.

The Maiar are Valar of less degree, and they help and serve the greatest valars. Their number is unknown by the elves. The most important ones:

- Ilmarë: Handmaid of Varda.
- Eönwë: Banner-bearer and herald of Manwë. The mightiest in arms of Arda.
- Ossë: Vassal of Ulmo. Master of the seas. Washes the shores. Loves coasts and isles. Sometimes, he is too wild.
- Uinen: Vassal of Ulmo. Lady of the seas. Spouse of Ossë. She loves sea creatures and sea weeds. She calms the waves at mariners cries, restraining Ossë wildness.
- Melian: Serves Vána and Estë.
- Olórin: Wisest maia. He learned pity and patience from Nienna. He loves the elves.

The enemies of the Valar and Maiar:

- Melkor: The most powerful valar. Called Morgoth by the elves. He desires the kingship of Manwë and the dominion over the realms of the Valar. He contended with the Valar, and held dominion over most of Arda for long years. He had many maiar by his side, such as:
- Balrogs: Dreadful scourges of fire.
- Sauron: Old maia of Aulë.

### Quenta Silmarillion (History of the Silmarils)

#### The beginning of days

Eä is the universe created from the Ainur's songs, and the Secret Fire is in its center. It is amid the Void, but is not part of it. There is a region in Eä called Arda (Earth), which is the place provided for the Children to live (a flat world). It is surrounded with the Walls of the Night, which surround the Outer Sea (Ekkaia). It contains different continents like Middle-earth (middle) and Aman (west).

The First War took place before Arda was fully-shaped, and no living things were still in it. Melkor had the upper hand, but Tulkas descended from heavens to help, and Melkor was forced to flee from Arda.

There was peace for a long age. At some point, Varda created the stars. The Valar lived in the Isle of Almaren, in the Great Lake, in Middle-earth. Yavanna planted the seeds she had devised. Aulë wrought 2 mighty lamps for the lighting of Middle-earth, Varda filled them, and Manwë hallowed them. The Valar set them in 2 high pillars, one at the north and one at the south. Plants and beast started to rise up.

Later, Melkor returned to Arda and built Utumno, a stronghold at the north of Middle-earth. Then, by surprise, he destroyed the pillars and spilled the lamps, which destroyed most of the Earth. Then, he took refuge in Utumno. Since Almaren was destroyed, the Valar went to Aman. They fortified Aman's shores by creating the Pelóri mountains (highest of Earth), lived in Valinor (region behind the mountains), and there built the city of Valmar. Near Valmar, Yavanna created the Two Trees of Valinor (Telperion and Laurelin), who casted light and warmth on the region. Manwë set his throne in the Pelóri, at the top of Taniquetil mountain.

####  Aulë and Yavanna

Aulë was impatient, he couldn't wait for the Children to come, and he wanted people to love and to teach, so he secretly created the dwarfs in Middle-Earth (more especifically, the 7 Fathers of the Dwarfs). Ilúvatar allowed their creation, but made them sleep because he wanted the elves to come first.

Aulë told Yavanna what happened and she was glad. But she worried about the fact that dwarfs and Children would dominate or damage her creation, specially the trees, so she asked Manwë about this. With the help of Ilúvatar, Manwë then realized that the Ainur's song included some details he didn't pay attention before: when the Children awake, Yavanna's creations will awake and summon spirits that will be powerful and reverenced. Furthermore, before the Children awake, the Eagles of the Lords of the West will fly.

#### The coming of elves and the captivity of Melkor

Without the lamps, Middle-Earth was dark. But the first living things arose: weeds in the sea, great trees in the earth, and dark creatures in the valleys. Melkor perverted some of these creatures and created evil monsters. The first spirits that adhered with him were called Balrogs. Middle-Earth was dominated by Melkor. He built Angband, a stronghold in the north-western shores of the sea, to resist any assault from Aman. It was commanded by his lieutenant, Sauron.

Elves awoke in the north-east of Middle-Earth, in Cuiviénen, a bay in the Inland Sea of Helcar. Melkor's servants discovered and spied them. Some elves were captured and converted into orcs. Oröme found the elves by chance during one of his huntings, and the Valars decided to make war to free Middle-Earth of evil.

Melkor met the Valar in the north-west of Middle-Earth, but he and his servants were forced to retreat to Utumno. Then, the Valar set a guard over Cuiviénen. Many battles were fought before the gates of Utumno, and the shape of Middle-Earth changed. Melkor was finally captured and cast into prision for 3 ages in the fortress of Mandos, in the west of Aman. However, many evil creatures were dispersed over the world or stayed hidden in caverns and vaults, and Sauron was not found.

The Valar offered the elves to come with them to Valinor. First, 3 elves visited Valinor: Ingwë, Finwë, Elwë. Then, some elves decided to stay (called Avari) and others decided to go (called Eldar):

- The kindred of Ingwë, lord of the Vanyar, friends of Manwë and Varda.
- Most kindreds of Finwë, lord of the Noldor, friends of Aulë
- Most kindreds of Elwë, lord of the Teleri together with his brother Olwë.

The journey took many years. Some elves got lost or turned aside (called Úmanyar) and stayed in Middle-Earth. Avari and Úmanyar were called Moriquendi.

In their way, they crossed the Anduin river, frontier of the west lands of Middle-Earth, and continued through the Misty mountains (reared by Melkor to hinder the riding of Oromë), entering Eriador. Many Teleri, afraid of the Misty mountains, turned aside leaded by Lenwë (called Nandor). The elves continued across Eriador and the Blue mountains, entering Beleriand, the westernmost land of Middle-Earth. They crossed Sirion river and reached the Great Sea between Drengist and the Bay of Balar. Afraid of the sea, many elves withdrew into Beleriand. The Teleri leaded by Elwë, who had stayed behind when crossing the Misty mountains, halted and dwelt a while in East Beleriand, beyond Gelion river.

#### Thingol and Melian

Melian was a maia that dwelt in the gardens of Lórien, in Valinor. When she heard about the elves awakening, she departed to Middle-Earth and filled the silence with her beautiful voice and the voices of her birds.

When the Teleri were resting in East Beleriand, many of the Noldor were staying in the forests of Neldoreth and Region. One day, Elwë was crossing the forest of Nan Elmoth in his way to visit his friend Finwë, when he met Melian by chance. He fell in love with her and, when he took her hand, a spell was laid on him: long years passed before they spoke any word. Elwë's folk couldn't find him, so his brother Olwë took the kingship of the Teleri and continued the journey.

Later, both Melian and Elwë (then called Elu Thingol) became kings of all the Eldar in Beleriand. Their hidden halls were in Menegroth, in Doriath.

#### Eldamar and the princess of the Eldalië

The northernmost part of Middle-Earth was only separated from Aman by a narrow sea filled with grinding ice. That was a difficult path, so Ulmo created an island that moved to the Bay of Balar, where the Vanyar and Noldor embarked, and then took them to Aman. Part of the island remained behind and was called the Isle of Balar.

The Teleri stayed in Middle-Earth because they were far from the sea and didn't hear the summons of Ulmo. They took Olwë as their king. Ossë and Uinen befriended them. Many years later, due to Noldors request, Ulmo decided to take the Teleri to Aman. The Teleri leaded by Olwë embarked to Aman, but some remained in Middle-Earth: the Falathrim (Elves of the Falas. Teleri convinced by Ossë to stay, the first mariners and makers of ships) and the Eglath (Forsaken people. Kinsfolk and friends of Elwë). Ossë convinced the Teleri of Olwë to ask Ulmo to stop the island, and he did so in the Bay of Eldamar, close to Aman. The isle was called Tol Eressëa (Lonely Isle).

Later, when Elwë awoke from his long trance, the Teleri in Beleriand took him as their king.

A valley (Calacirya) was made in the Pelóri, in front of the isle, and the Vanyar and Noldor built there the city of Tirion, the first city of elves. While quarrying in the hills after stone, the Noldor first discovered the earth-gems. Finwë, king of the Noldor, had 3 sons, who in turn had many sons:

- Fëanor (skillful in word and hand): Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin, Amrod, Amras.
- Fingolfin (strong and valiant): Fingon, Turgon, Aredhel.
- Finarfin (fair and wise): Finrod/Felagund, Orodreth, Angrod, Aegnor, Galadriel.

The Teleri dwelt in Tol Eressëa for a long age, but they finally decided to move to Aman. Ulmo sent Ossë to teach them ship-building so they could sail to Aman. In Aman, they built the city of Alqualondë in the north shores of Eldamar. Later, the Vanyar decided to move closer to the Valar: to Taniquetil and Valinor. Ingwë was considered the High King of all Elves; Finwë, the king of Tirion; and Elwë, the king of Alqualondë.

#### Fëanor and the unchaining of Melkor

Fëanor's mother (Míriel) died giving birth to him. Fëanor discovered how to make great gems. He also learned how to make things in metal and stone, and explored Aman. His father, Finwë, took a second wife (Indis, a Vanya) with whom he had 2 children: Fingolfin and Finarfin. But Fëanor didn't love much her, nor his sons.

Three ages had passed since the capture of Melkor, so he was presented in front of Manwë. He sued for pardon and promised to aid the Valar in their works, and Manwë granted him pardon. But inside, he was full of hate and envy, specially towards the Eldar.

#### The Silmarils and the unrest of the Noldor

Fëanor created the silmarills, three unbreakable great jewels made of an unknown material. They look like diamond but are stronger than adamant. They have an inner fire made of light from the Trees of Valinor. 

Secretly, Melkor told the elves about the coming of Men and spread many lies:

- Manwë was keeping them captive so that Men could take control of Middle-Earth because they would be easier to control for them.
- Fingolfin and his sons were plotting to usurp Finwë's leadership and the line of Fëanor.
- The Valar secretly desired to possess the silmarills.
- Fëanor had his father in his hands and intended to kick Fingolfin and Finarfin out from Tirion.

Pride and anger awoke among the Noldor. Fëanor started to speaking openly against his brothers and the Valar. The Valar thought that Fëanor was the cause of the broken peace in Valinor, so they called him for an interrogation. Soon, the malice of Melkor was revealed, and he hid himself so Valar couldn't find him. Fëanor was sentenced to leave Tirion for 12 years, so he and his 7 sons moved to the north, to Formenos (fortress north of Eldamar). Finwë also moved there, so Fingolfin ruled the Noldor in Tirion.

#### The darkening of Valinor

The Valar couldn't find Melkor. He had gone to Avathar, an unexplored territory to the south-east, in the narrow space between the Pelóri and the sea. There was living Ungoliant, hidden in a ravine, in the shape of a giant spider that emits darkness (its origin is unknown, but it's said that she came from the darkness around Arda and is one of the first Melkor corrupted to his service). With the help of Ungoliant, Melkor climbed over the Pelóri and crossed to the other side.

Meanwhile, Valar, Maiar, Vanyar and Noldor were feasting in Taniquetil. In that feast, Fëanor and Fingolfin met and reconciled.

Melkor and Ungoliant hurried to the Trees of Valinor, and Ungoliant consumed them to death, which made Valmar fall into darkness. Then, both continued running to the north and escaped. Oromë and Tulkas almost get Melkor, but they couldn't reach him because he was covered in the darkness of Ungoliant.

#### The flight of the Noldor

In their escape, Melkor and Ungoliant reached Formenos, where Melkor killed Finwë and stole the silmarills (after this, Fëanor called Melkor, Morgoth). Then, they went to Middle-Earth through Helcaraxë (narrow frozen strait linking Aman and Middle-Earth in the north). In Lammoth, both fought each other for the silmarills. Some balrogs hidden in Angband's vaults came to help Melkor and Ungoliant was forced to escape to Nan Dungortheb. Melkor stayed in Angband.

For some time, Ungoliant stayed in Nan Dungortheb and mated other spider-form creatures. Later, leaving her offspring there, she departed to the forgotten south of the world. It's said that she died after devouring herself during her uttermost famine.

Fëanor claimed the kingship of the Noldor and convinced them to leave Aman. His speech was full of Melkor's lies. He didn't trust the Valar, wanted to recover the silmarills, and to create a kingdom in Middle-Earth. Most of them decided to follow him to Middle-Earth in search of new lands, while one tithe stayed. Fingolfin and Finarfin were eager to leave Aman, but decided to follow the Noldor.

The Noldor arrived to Alqualondë and Fëanor asked the Teleri (leaded by Olwë) to join them and asked for their ships. The Teleri refused and tried to convince them to stay in Aman. Fëanor decided to take the ships by force, so a battle took place. The Teleri were soon overcame and the ships were captured. Later, Uinen rose the sea in wrath and wrecked some of them.

The Noldor continued their journey to the north, some by ship and some by land. Finarfin, filled with grief, decided to turn back to Tirion with some of his people, where he was set to rule the remnants of the Noldor in Aman. But his sons continued the journey.

Helcaraxë deemed impassable, but the ships were too few. Then, Fëanor decided to secretly board the ships with all whom he deemed true to him, and leave Fingolfin and his people in Aman. Fëanor reached the firth of Drengist and entered into Dor-Lómin. However, Fingolfin decided to go through Helcaraxë and finally reached Middle-Earth, although some of them died along the way.

#### The Sindar

Melian and Elu Thingol (Elwë) were the kings of all the Eldar in Beleriand. These moriquendi were the Sindar (grey elves). At the end of the first age of the the captivity of Melkor they had a daughter: Lúthien.

During the second age of the captivity, the Dwarves came over the Blue mountains of Ered Luin into Beleriand. They came from 2 cities they had delved in the eastern side of Ered Luin: Gabilgathol/Belegost (north of Mount Dolmed) and Tumunzahar/Nogrod (southward). There was a another city far to the east: Khazad-dûm (at Misty mountains), later called Moria. King Thingol welcomed them, and elves and dwarves traded with each other.

Melian forsaw that peace would not last for ever so, with the help of dwarves, Thingol built Menegroth, a fortress with the shape of a rocky hill over river Esgalduin, between Neldoreth and Region.

Meanwhile, in the darkness, the dark creatures multiplied. During the third age of the captivity, they started to come to Beleriand from the north and the south (orcs, wolf-shaped creatures, etc.). Thingol and the dwarves made weapons to defend themselves.

In the past, the Nandor were leaded by Lenwë down the Anduin river. Some of them reached the river's mouth while others passed by Ered Nimrais and entered Eriador. The coming of the dark creatures made some of them, leaded by the son of Lenwë, Denethor, to cross the mountains into Beleriand. Thingol welcomed them and they dwelt in Ossiriand.

One day, Morgoth and Ungolianth came back to Middle-Earth. The powers of Melian prevented Ungolianth from entering Neldoreth, so she abode long time in Ered Gorgoroth. Morgoth returned to Angband, gathered an army of orcs, and sent it to attack King Thingol. The orcs passed silently into the highlands of the north and suddenly invaded the regions around Menegroth: the east (between Celon and Gelion rivers) and west (between Sirion and Narog rivers).

Thingol asked Denethor for help, and the eastern host of orcs was taken between the armies of the Eldar and defeated north of Andram (First Battle in the Wars of Beleriand). Those orcs that fled north were waylaid by the dwarves from Mount Dolmed. Few orcs returned to Angband. However, the Nandor were light-armed, and Denethor fell in Amon Ereb. The Nandor took no king again and never came to open war again. They kept themselves in wariness and secrecy, and were called Laiquendi (Green elves). Many went north, entered the guarded realm of Thingol, and merged with his people.

The western orc-host was victorious and Thingol withdrew all his people within Neldoreth and Region. Melian fenced this dominion round about with an invisible wall of shadow and bewilderment (the Girdle of Melian) that nobody could pass against her will. This inner land was called Doriath, the guarded kingdom. Only Doriath and the walled havens of the Falas (Eglarest and Brithombar) were free of enemies.

At this time, Fëanor landed in the Firth of Drengist and fired the ships.

#### The sun and moon, and the hiding of Valinor

Nienna and Yavanna tried to save the trees, but all was vain. Before dying, Telperion bore upon a great flower of silver (Moon), and Laurelin a fruit of gold (Sun). Aüle made 2 vessels to hold and preserve their light, and Arda made them fly in the heaven, nearer to Arda than the stars. Two maiar were chosen to guide them through the sky: Arien (sun) and Tilion (moon). They fly from east to west, then go under the Earth and the cycle repeats.

Meanwhile, Fingolfin and his people began their march into Middle-Earth. Morgoth sent dark clouds to hide his land from the sun. He didn't dare to attack Arien, but he sent spirits to attack Tilion, though Tilion defeated them. Morgoth was not as powerful as he used to be because his might was passed into many evil creatures.

In Aman, the Valar raised up the Pelóri even higher, east, north and south, except for the Calacirya, with great precipices in the outer sides. Towers and sentinels were set on the mountains, and a host was encamped upon the plains of Valmar. From north to south, the Enchanted Isles were set, covered by shadows and bewilderment. Hardly any vessel could pass between them because the waves hit rocks shrouded in mist. All those who ever set foot upon the islands were entrapped, and slept until the Change of the World. Therefore, Aman was shut down.

#### The Men

At the first rising of the Sun, Men awoke in Hildórien (eastward regions of Middle-earth). They met Dark Elves and were befriended by them. Morgoth was moreover checked by the Sun, so there was little peril in the lands. Men spread west, north and south. Nobody knows what befall their spirits after death, only Mandos, Manwë and Ilúvatar know.

#### The return of the Noldor

Fëanor and his sons landed in Lammoth, in the Firth of Drengist, and burned their ships. They crossed Hithlum and encamped in the northern shore of the lake of Mithrim. Before their camp was ready, they were attacked by the host of Morgoth (Second Battle in the Wars of Beleriand). Though outnumbered, the Noldor were victorious. The orcs fled and were hunted over the Ered Wethrim mountains and the plains of Ard-galen.

To their aid came the armies that had passed south into the Vale of Sirion and were besieging the Havens of the Falas. But Celegorm, having news of them, waylaid them with part of the Elven-host, coming down upon them out of the hills near Eithel Sirion, and drove them into the Fen of Serech. The battle lasted 10 days and only a handfull of leaves returned to Angband.

Fëanor drew far ahead of the van of his host, knowing nothing about Angband. Seeing this, the enemies turned to bay, and Balrogs came from Angband to aid them. Fëanor and a few friends were surrounded and he was smitten to the ground by Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs. His sons came up with force and saved him, but he died from his wounds shortly after.

Morgoth, acknowledging defeat, and offering terms, proposed a meeting. Maedhros met his emissaries, but he was captured and taken to Angband. Morgoth sent word that he would release Maedhros if the Noldor leave Beleriand, but they didn't trust him. They fortified a great camp in Hithlum.

Meanwhile, the host of Fingolfin arrived to Mithrim after going by the coast and through the Firth of Drengist. At the rise of the Sun, the enemies fled to Angband, and Fingolfin marched there unopposed. Acknowledging the strength of Angband, he returned and made a camp by the northern shores of lake Mithrim. Fëanor's people, in turn, moved to the southern shore.

From Angband, smokes and vapours were made and spread from the tops of the Iron Mountains (immense mountain range in the north of Middle-earth). They covered Hithlum and poisoned the waters of Mithrim. Fingon and Maedhros had been close in friendship, so he dedided to infiltrate alone in search of Maedhros, aided by Morgoth's darkness. He climbed the Thangorodrim (volcano over Angband), looking for a pass into Angband, when he found Maedhros hanging from a precipice. Fingon couldn't reach him, but Thorondor, King of Eagles, came to his aid (eagles had been sent to the north by Manwë to keep watch upon Morgoth). Unable to cut the bond upon Maedhros' wrist, Fingon was forced to cut his hand in order to save him. Then, Thorondor took them to Mithrim. By this deed, the hatred between the houses of Fingolfin and Fëanor was assuaged, and the Noldor were united again under Fingolfin. 

Angband was besieged from west, south and east. Maedhros and his people moved to the region of the Hill of Himring. Caranthir and his people moved to lake Helevorn, and even met dwarves with whom they traded and made an alliance.

Some decades later, after visiting Menegroth, Finrod decided to build a similar fortress, so he built Nargothrond with the aid of dwarves from the Blue mountains. There was love between Galadriel and Celeborn, a kinsman of Thingol, so she stayed in Menegroth and learned much from Melian. Turgon, who was living in Vinyamar (Nevrast), yearned for Tirion, so Ulmo showed him the hidden vale of Tumladen, and he planned to build a city there.

Morgoth then sent orcs across Ard-galen and they went through the Pass of Sirion (west) and the land of Maglor (east) (gap between the hills of Maedhros and the outliers of the Blue mountains). While others took care of the scattered bands of orcs strayed in Beleriand, Fingolfin and Maedhros came upon the main host from either side as it was assaulting Dorthonion and utterly defeated it (Third great battle of the Wars of Beleriand). The Noldor couldn't pass through the Iron mountains, so the Siege of Angband was set (it lasted 400 years). Nearly 100 years after the battle, Morgoth sent an army to the north-west and it tried to enter Hithlum, but they were spied and Fingon fell upon them in the Firth of Drengist and drove them to the sea. After 100 more years, Glaurung, the first dragon, was issued from Angband, and the elves at Ard-galen escaped in dismay to Ered Wethrin and Dorthonion. But Fingon and some archers on horseback attacked him, and he fled back to Angband. The next 200 years there was peace and Beleriand prospered.

#### Beleriand and its realms

In the north, Morgoth had in the ages past reared the Iron Mountains, like a fence to Utumno. In the west, behind the mountains, he also built Angband as a defence against attacks coming from Valinor. When he came back to Middle-earth, he lived in Angband because it was not fully destroyed or explored by the Valar during the War of the Powers of the Valar. Beneath the mountains, he made a great tunnel, which issued south of the mountains through a mighty gate. Above and behind this gate, he built Thangorodrim (three great volcanoes). To the south there was the wide plain of Ard-galen.

In Beleriand, the Noldor controlled different regions:

- Fingolfin's people controlled the north-west (Hithlum).
- Finrod and his brothers controlled the south-west (Realm of Nargothrond, and Dorthonion).
- Maedhros and his brothers controlled the north-east (March of Maedhros, Himlad, land between Little Gelion and Greater Gelion, and Lake Helevorn)
- King Thingol controlled Doriath.

Fingolfin's:

To the west lays Hithlum, covered by the clouds sent by Morgoth, and surrounded by Ered Lómin and Ered Wethrin. Fingolfin and Fingon held Hithlum. Most of Fingolfin's folk dwelt in Mithrim, in the shores of Lake Mithrim. Dor-lómin was assigned to Fingon. Their chief fortress was Eithel Sirion, from where they kept watch upon Ard-galen, and their cavalry rode upon that plain even close to Thangorodrim. Nevrast was the realm of Turgon, who lived in Vinyamar, under Mount Taras beside the sea.

Finrod's:

South of Arg-galen, Dorthonion stretched for 60 leagues from west to east. It arises from the plain with gentle slopes and end up in the south with great peaks. Southward, where it looked towards Doriath, it fell suddenly in dreadful precipices. From the northern slopes, Angrod and Aegnor looked out over Ard-galen. They were vasals of Finrod, lord of Nargothrond. In the isle of Tol Sirion, in a narrow vale between Dorthonion and Ered Wethrin, Finrod built Minas Tirith, a mighty watch-tower for controlling the Pass of Sirion. After building Nargothrond, it was given to Orodreth.

From the Pass of Sirion, the river flows south for 130 leagues until reaching the Bay of Balar. The river Narog flows some 80 leagues from the falls of Ivrin until joining Sirion in Nan-tathren. Few folks dwelt south of Nan-tathren, a region of meads. Beyond lay marshes and isles of reed about the mouths of Sirion, and nobody lives in the sands of his delta.

The realm of Nargothrond extends to river Nenning. Finrod was the lord of all elves between Sirion and the sea, save only in the Falas. Círdan was the lord of the Falas, where those who still loved ships lived. Círdan and Finrod were good friends. West of Eglarest, Finrod raised the tower of Barad Nimras, in case Morgoth attacks from the sea. 

Thingol's and surroundings:

From Sirion to Gelion, there are 100 leagues at its widest. Dimbar was an empty land. Nan Dungortheb was a region filled with fear because Ungolianth, who dwelt there a while, had left her offspring, and the waters spilled from there were toxic.

Doriath was the abode of king Thingol, into whose realm none passed save by his will, and Menegroth were upon the southern bank of Esgalduin. Some 25 leagues east form Nargothrond were the Falls of Sirion, where the river fell in a mighty fall and then plunged suddenly underground into great tunnels that the weight of his falling waters delved, and then issued 3 leagues southward through the Gates of Sirion (rocky arches at the foot of the hills).

Andram was a long fall from Nargothrond to Ramdal. From north to south, the land fell suddenly and steeply. Taur-im-Duinath was wild land of tangled forest in which no folk went, save a few Dark Elves wandering.

Green elves':

From the meeting of Little Gelion and Greater Gelion, river Gelion flows for south for 40 leagues before finding his 6 tributaries. River Gelion is twice as long as Sirion before finding the sea, but less wide and full. In Ossiriand, the land between Ered Luin and rivers Ascar, Adurant, Gelion, dwelt the Green-elves.

Maedhros':

The sons of Fëanor dwelt east of Dorthonion, under Maedhros. Their riders passed often over Lothlann, the empty east of Ard-galen. The chief citadel of Maedhros was upon the Hill of Himring. Celegorm and Curufin fortified the Pass of Aglon, a gate unto Doriath, and held it together with Himlad. Maglor was in charge of the regions between Little and Greater Gelion, and a strength of cavalry was held in the plains there. Caranthir fortified the mountains to the east of Maglor's gap and lived beside Lake Helevorn. The Noldor first met the dwarves at Thargelion. Amrod and Amras lived southward, and they came seldom northward.

None of the Noldor went ever over Ered Lindon, while their realm lasted. The Noldor lords were:

- Fëanor (dead)
  - Maedhros: Lord of Himring
  - Maglor: Regions between Little and Greater Gelion
  - Celegorm: Himlad and Pass of Aglon
  - Caranthir: Lake Helevorn
  - Curufin: Himlad and Pass of Aglon
  - Amrod: South-east
  - Amras: South-east
- Fingolfin: Overlord of all the Noldor. Lord of northern Hithlum.
  - Fingon: Lord of Dor-lómin
  - Turgon: Lord of Nevrast
  - Aredhel: Nevrast
- Finarfin: Stayed in Valinor. Lord of Tirion.
  - Finrod: Lord of Nargothrond
  - Orodreth: Minas Tirith (Tol Sirion)
  - Angrod: Dorthonion
  - Aegnor: Dorthonion
  - Galadriel: Stayed in Menegroth

#### The Noldor in Beleriand

Turgon secretely started building the city of Gondolin in the hidden vale of Tumladen. The access to Tumladen was through a deep way under the mountains delved by waters that flowed out to join Sirion (Dry River). After 52 years, the city was finished and Turgon took all his people, a third part of Fingolfin's people, and secretely moved to Gondolin, shutting the gates behind them and leaving Nevrast empty. Nobody knew where they went, and they didn't leave for more than 350 years.

#### Maeglin

Aredhel dwelt in Nevrast and moved to Gondolin with him. After 200 years, she asked Turgon to leave because she wanted to ride in the wide lands and walk in the forests. He appointed 3 lords of his household to ride with her. She wanted to visit the sons of Fëanor, their old friends, so they continued by the north of Doriath, but she got lost in Nan Dungortheb. Her companions looked for her but got attacked by the fell creatures of Ungoliant, so they escaped to Gondolin. Finally, Aredhel arrived to Himlad, but Celegorm and Curufin were not there because they went to visit Caranthir, in Thargelion. She waited for months, but one day she got lost in the dark forest of Nan Elmoth. There was living Eöl, a dark elf from Doriath that was friend of the dwarves.

He saw Aredhel and attracted her with an enchantment towards his house. They met and he took her as his wife. Later, she bore a son: Maeglin. Eöl didn't like the Noldor (they killed and invaded the Teleri) and forbade Aredhel and Maeglin to visit them. Eöl was sometimes invited to Nogrod and Belegost. One day, while Eöl went to Nogrod, Maeglin and Aredhel escaped towards Gondolin. Two days later, Eöl arrived home and, driven by anger, decided to follow them. Aredhel and Maeglin arrived to Gondolin, but closely followed by Eöl who was captured by the guards and brought to Turgon. Nobody was allowed to leave Gondolin once he had seen it, so he was forced to stay. Then, Eöl tried to kill his son with a poisoned javelin, but Aredhel sprang before the dart and died. The next day Eöl was executed.

#### The coming of Men into the West

When 300 years passed after the Noldor arrived to Beleriand, Finrod went hunting with Maedhros and Maglor. He got lost and ended up in Ossiriand, in the upper streams of river Ascar, where he met a group of men leaded by Bëor, the first men to enter Beleriand. Bëor told that there were more men that had crossed the mountains, and others called the Haladin were still in the eastern slopes, and also numerous people were marching west leaded by Marach. Since the Green-elves were troubled with men, Bëor's people took abode in Estolad. After Bëor died, his son Baran took leadership.

Soon after, the Haladin people arrived to Beleriand, but meeting the unfriendship of the Green-elves, they dwelt in Thargelion. A year later, Marach led his people over the mountains and settled south and east of Baran's people, and there was friendship between them. These three groups of men were friends of the Noldor and were called Edain.

Fifty years later some men moved again, this time through the north because the west was blocked by Doriath and the impassable fens of Sirion. Bëor's people moved to Dorthonion. The son of Marach, Aradan, moved with most of his people to Hithlum. Aradan's son, Magor, and many of his people, dwelt a while in the southern slopes of Ered Wethrin. King Thingol didn't allow men to enter into Doriath.

Some men grew discontent of the Eldar and afraid of Morgoth. Bereg (house of Bëor) led a thousand of his people southward. Some of Marach people moved back to Eriador.

Morgoth sent an Orc-raid that came in stealth over Ered Lindon and fell upon the Haladin, in Thargelion. A man named Haldad gathered all the men that he could find and retreated to the angle of land between Ascar and Gelion and built a stockade across from water to water. They were besieged, and Haldad died, together with his son, Haldar, so Haldad's daugther, Haleth, took the lead. They were almost defeated when Caranthir came to the rescue from the north and drove the orcs into the rivers. After this, Haleth led his people to Estolad, then through Nan Dungortheb to Talath Dirnen (the Guarded Plain), where some of them wandered into the realm of Nargothrond, and later she led many of them to the Forest of Brethil. Haleth successor was Haldan, son of her brother Haldar.

Fingolfin gave Hador (son of Hathol, son of Magor) the lordship of Dor-lómin, where Hador moved most of his people. To Boromir (son of Boron, grandson of Bëor) was given the lordship of Bëor's people and the country of Ladros, in Dorthonion.

Groups of Edain and their movements:

- Bëor's people:
  - Bëor leads them through Blue mountains to Estoland
  - Baran (Bëor's son) takes leadership
  - People move to Dorthonion
  - Bereg (house of Bëor) led a thousand (discontent and afraid) people southward
  - Boron (grandson of Bëor) becomes leader
  - Boromir (son of Boron) is given Ladros (in Dorthonion)

- Haladin:
  - They cross Blue mountains and stay in Thargelion
  - Orc raid. Haldad leads the retreat and defense, but he and his son (Haldar) die. Caranthir cames to the rescue
  - Haleth (Haldad's dauther) leads them to Talath Dirnen
  - Haleth moves many to the Forest of Brethil
  - Haldan (son of Haleth's brother, Haldar) becomes leader

- Marach's people:
  - Marach leads them through Blue mountains to East Estolad
  - Aradan (Marach's son) move most people to Hithlum
  - Magor (Aradan's son) move most people to Ered Wethrin
  - Some (discontent and afraid) people move back to Eriador
  - Hathol (son of Magor) becomes leader
  - Hador (son of Hathol) moves most people to Dor-lómin (land given by Fingolfin)

#### The ruin of Beleriand and the fall of Fingolfin

After 455 years since the coming of Fingolfin, when the sixth generation of men after Bëor and Marach were not yet come to full manhood, Morgoth sent forth great rivers of flame from Thangorodrim that covered Ard-galen and killed all life there. Dorthonion and Ered Wethrin held back the fiery torrents. From Angband marched Glaurung (in his full might), Balrogs, and huge armies of orcs. The Battle of Sudden Flame (the Fourth battle) started in winter and ended in spring, and Finarfin's sons suffered the most. The Noldor's fortresses fell. Most of the Grey-elves fled south and forsook the northern war.

Angrod and Aegnor were slain, next to Bregolas, lord of the house of Bëor. Barahir, brother of Bregolas and new lord of the house of Bëor, was fighting near the Pass of Sirion. Finrod, hastening from the south, was surrounded in the Fen of Serech, but Barahir came with some men and saved him. Bregolas returned to Dorthonion, but most of his people fled to Hithlum.

Fingolfin and Fingon tried come to the aid of Finarfin's sons, but their armies were driven back to the fortresses of Ered Wethrin. Hador fell upon the walls of Eithel Sirion defending the rearguard of his lord Fingolfin. Galdor, his son, took the lordship of his father. Hithlum remained unconquered but Fingolfin was sundered from his kinsmen.

The east marches were taken by assault. The Pass of Aglon was forced and Celegorm and Curufin fled south and west to Nargothrond. Maedhros resisted in the fortress of the Hill of Himring, which could not be taken, and even managed to close the Pass of Aglon.

Upon Lothlann, Glaurung passed through Maglor's Gap and destroyed all the land between the arms of Gelion. The orcs took the fortress next to Mount Rerir, and ravaged all Thargelion. Then, they passed over Gelion and came into East Beleriand. Maglor joined Maedhros upon Himring. Caranthir, Amrod and Amras retreated, passed Ramdal, and maintained some strength upon Amon Ereb; and with the aid of Green-elves, no orcs came into Ossiriand nor to Taur-im-Duinath.

With great rage, Fingolfin rode alone to Angband and challenged Morgoth to a single combat. He managed to wound Morgoth several times, but finally was defeated and killed. Fingon took the lordship of the house of Fingolfin and the kingdom of the Noldor, and took his son Gil-Galad to the Havens of the Falas.

Barahir remained in Dorthonion contesting the land with his enemies, but finally that land was taken. The women and children left through the mountains. Some went to Brethil (with the Haladin) and some went to Dorlómin (with Galdor's people). Beren, son of Barahir, alone escaping came hardly into Doriath. The men that stayed fighting were slained one by one.

For two years the Noldor defended the pass about the sources of Sirion and Minas Tirith. Finally, Sauron (greatest servant of Morgoth, who became a sorcerer) took Tol Sirion and Orodreth fled to Nargothrond. Tol Sirion was made a stronghold for Morgoth. Morgoth pursued his foes and took their strongholds one by one. The orcs came down Sirion and wandered from Sirion to Celon rivers, encompassing Doriath.

At this time, the Swarthy Men came first into Beleriand. Some of them were secretly under the dominion of Morgoth. Maedhros gave his friendship to the greatest of their chieftains: Bór and Ulfang. Bór and his sons (Borlad, Borlach, Borthand) followed Maedhros and Maglor. Ulfang and his sons (Ulfast, Ulwarth, Uldor) followed Caranthir.

The orcs reached the Forest of Brethil, which was defended by the Haladin, leaded by Halmir. He asked Thingol, who sent a great force leaded by Beleg. Both destroyed the orcs, who didn't dare to cross the Teiglin river for many years after, preventing the invasion of the kingdom of Nargothrond.

Húrin and Huor (sons of Galdor), who were attending to a feast at Brethil (Galdor and Glóredhel, children of Hador, were wedded to Hareth and Haldir, children of Halmir), fought against the orcs. However, they got cut off and pursued to the Ford of Brithiach were they managed to escape thanks to a mist raised from Sirion river by Ulmo, but they got lost at Dimbar, beneath the walls of Crissaegrim. Thorondor, who spied them, sent two eagles to their aid and they were brought to Gondolin, which no man yet had seen. King Turgon received them and they dwelt as guests in the King’s house. After one year, they asked Turgon to return with their people. They swore to keep the secret about all that they had seen, and Turgon granted their prayer. The eagles took them to Dor-lómin.

Knowing about the end of the Siege, Turgon secretly sent companies to the mouths of Sirion and Isle of Balar to build ships and sail to Valinor to ask for pardon and aid of the Valar. However, no messenger reached Valinor since it was hidden behind sadow, enchantment, and a wild wide sea. Many were lost and few returned.

Morgoth, despite his victories, also suffered great losses, and felt that he had not measured rightly
the strength of the Noldor and Men. He decided to recall the main hosts of the Orcs to Angband to gather a new strength. After seven years since the Fourth battle, he renewed the assault. A great force attacked Hithlum. At the siege of Eithel Sirion, Galdor was slained by an arrow, but his son Húrin (new leader of the house of Hador in Dor-lómin) drove the Orcs with heavy slaughter from Ered Wethrin, and pursued them far across the sands of Anfauglith. 

King Fingon, who was outnumbered, had a difficult time trying to hold back an army coming from the north into the plains of Hithlum. However, the ships of Círdan sailed in great strength up the Firth of Drengist, and in the hour of need the Elves of the Falas came upon the enemy from the west. The Orcs broke and fled, and horsed archers pursued them even into the Iron Mountains.

1.3.19. Beren and Lúthien

Barahir didn't forsake Dorthonion and stayed there. When only 12 companions remained with him, they withdrew and hid in the highlands, by lake Tarn Aeluin. The rumours of their deeds went far and wide, and Morgoth commanded Sauron to find and destroy them. Gorlim, one of the companions, was captured by Sauron and, under torture and false promises, he revealed Barahir's hidding. Then, Gorlim was killed, and the Orcs killed the others in a surprise attack, save Beren (son of Barahir) who was far afield in a espionage mission.

Beren stayed 4 years more in Dorthonion as a solitary outlaw. His deeds were noised abroad and Morgoth set a high price upon his head. Sauron was looking for him with an army. He was pressed so hard that he was forced to flee from Dorthonion. He crossed the dangerous Ered Gorgoroth and the wilderness of Dungortheb, and entered Doriath through the mazes that Melian wove about the kingdom of Thingol. He got lost in Neldoreth, where he met Lúthien, and both fell in love. When Thingol learned about this, he captured Beren and brought it to Menegroth for punishment. However, he finally asked him for a Silmaril from the Iron crown of Morgoth in exchange of Lúthien's hand.

Beren went to the south, through the Fens of Sirion, and climbed above the Falls of Sirion. Then, he went through Talath Dirnen until he was halted by guardian elves and taken to Finrod, at Nargothrond. Finrod knew him, and Beren told him about his mission. Finrod decided to help him, so he gave the crown of Nargothrond to Orodreth and joined Beren with 10 loyal companions. They journeyed beside Narog to his source in the Fall of Ivrin, where they attacked a company of Orcs at night and took their gears and weapons. Disguised as Orcs, they tried to cross the western pass, but Sauron, at Tol-in-Gaurhoth (former Tol Sirion), was suspicious and captured them. He casted them into a pit, but couldn't discover their names or purposes.

Lúthien was worried and asked Melian, who told her where he was. Lúthien resolved to go with him but, Thingol locked her up in a house on a tree, with guards and no ladder, to prevent it. However, she escaped using enchantments: she caused her hair to grow to great length and used it to make a rope, and made the guards sleep.

Celegorm and Curufin were on a hunt with their hounds at the Guarded Plain, near Doriath (Sauron had sent some wolves). Huan was the chief of wolf-hounds following Celegorm, given to him by Oromë at Valinor. He found Lúthien flying under the trees and brought her to Celegorm, who became enamoured of her. Both brothers held her at Nargothrond with the purpose of forcing Thingol to give her hand to Celegorm, so they could become the mightiest princes of the Noldor. They also wanted to let Finrod perish. Orodreth had no power to withstand them, for they swayed the hearts of the people of Nargothrond. However, Huan, who felt the love of Lúthien, led her by secret ways and both escaped.

When they arrived to the bridge of Tol-in-Gaurhoth, Sauron sent wolves (including Draugluin), but Huan killed them all. Then, Sauron himself fought Huan, but was defeated too. He surrendered Tol-in-Gaurhoth to Lúthien and went to Taur-nu-Fuin. Inside, Lúthien discovered that Finrod and his men were death, but Beren and other prisioners were still alive. Then, Huan returned to Celegorm.

Many of these elves returned to Nargothrond. Celegorm and Curufin were perceived as traitors and the hearts of the people of Nargothrond returned to Orodreth, who swore that there should be little love for Fëanor's sons. Then, the two brothers left Nargothrond towards Himring, where Maedhros dwelt. Celebrimbor (son of Curufin) repudiated the deeds of his father and remained in Nargothrond. The two brothers intended to pass through Dimbar and the north marches of Doriath. On their way between the Forest of Brethil and Doriath, they found Beren and Lúthien. They attacked Beren and tried to capture Lúthien, but were defeated with the help of Huan, who forsook the service of Celegorm, so the brothers continued they journey to Himring.

Beren wanted to continue his mission alone and tried to leave Lúthien at Doriath, but she followed him with Huan. They crossed the Pass of Sirion and Anfauglith, and reached the Gate of Angband. It was guarded by a werewolf (Carcharoth, son of Draugluin), but he felt asleep at Lúthien's command. Huan went to seek some help, and Beren and Lúthien crossed the gate. They meet Morgoth in his nethermost hall, and Lúthien sang in front of him in a way that Morgoth and all his court fell asleep. Beren took one silmaril from his crown and both escaped. At the gates, Carcharoth attacked them. Beren tried to stop him but Carcharot bit his hand off and ate the silmaril, which seared his flesh from inside. While the hosts of Morgoth started to wake up, three eagles (from Crissaegrim) came to the rescue and took them to Doriath. During the flight, Lúthien could see the hidden city of Gondolin. Beren took Lúthien back to Thingol who, finally, gave him the hand of Lúthien.

Carcharoth, in his madness, run destroying everything on its way from the north, went over east Taur-nu-Fuin and the sources of the Esgalduin, and entered Doriath. He was getting closer to Menegroth, so Thingol, Beren, Huan, and other elves went to hunt him. Huan managed to kill him, but Beren and Huan died. Later, Lúthien's spirit left her body and fled to the halls of Mandos.

Mandos, moved by Lúthien, went to Manwë, who knew Ilúvatar's will, and offered her two choices: go to Valimar alone, or return as a mortal to Middle-Earth with Beren. She chose the last option.

#### The fifth battle: Nirnaeth Arnoediad

Beren and Lúthien dwelt for a while in Doriath and visited Menegroth. Then, they went to Ossiriand and dwelt in the isle of Tol Galen.

Dior Aranel / Dior Eluchíl / Thingol's heir

Maedros, knowing the deeds of Beren and Lúthien, perceived that Morgoth was not unassailable, so he decided to make a new league against him.

- Maedhros' brothers joined.
- Fingon joined.
- Nargothrond (Orodreth) didn't join (save prince Gwindor, son of Guilin, who joined Fingon forces) due to the deed of Celegorm and Curufin.
- Doriath (Thingol) didn't join (save Mablung and Beleg) due to the malice of Celegorm and Curufin, the threatens received for surrendering the silmaril, and Thingol's desire of keeping the silmaril.
- Elves of the Falas joined Fingon forces.
- The dwarves helped with armed forces and weapons from the smithies of Nogrod and Belegost.
- The men of Bór and Ulfang joined, and even brought more men from the East.
- The men of the house of Hador (from Dor-lómin), leaded by Húrin, and his brother Huor, joined Fingon forces.
- Haldir, son of Halmir, lord of the People of Haleth (from the forest of Brethil), joined Fingon forces.

The plan was to assault Angband from east and west. Maedhros would lead an army from the east. He expected Morgoth to send his armies in answer. Then, following a signal (a firing of a great beacon in Dorthonion), Fingon would issue forth an army from the passes of Hithlum and attack the enemy too, taking him between anvil and hammer. Right before the battle, unsummoned and unexpected, Turgon opened the leaguer of Gondolin and he stationed his forces guarding the Pass of Sirion. Maedhros made the first move and advanced with his army over Anfauglith while Fingon forces waited the signal hidden on the valleys and woods of east Ered Wethrin and Eithel Sirion. 

Morgoth knew about their plans thanks to his spies and sent a force of orcs towards Hithlum. Fingon forces waited for them on the hills, but the orcs had been commanded to draw out Fingon swiftly from his hills by whatever means they could. After some provocations (in front of Eithel Sirion they killed Gelmir, brother of Gwindor and prisioner from the Dagor Bragollach) the host of Hithlum leapt forth from the hills leaded by Gwindor and this company, and swiftly destroy the enemy forces. They advanced until they reached the Gate of Angband. Gwindor and his company burst through the Gate and slew the guards, but they were trapped and slain, save Gwindor who they took alive. Morgoth's main host was issued forward by many secret doors in Thangorodrim. Fingon could not come to their aid and was beaten back with great loss from the walls. Fingon host retreated on the fourth day of the war. Haldir and most Men of Brethil were slain in the rearguard. The fifth day, as night fell, while they were still far from Ered Wethrin, the orcs surrounded the host of Hithlum and a battle started. They fought the whole night until Turgon forces (leaded by the king's guard phalanx) came in the morning to the rescue. Shortly after, they heard the trumpets of Maedhros coming up form the east, and Maedhros forces assailed the enemy in the rear.

Angband was empty now, and there came wolves, wolfriders, Balrogs, and dragons (including Glaurung). However, victory seemed attainable. But they didn't expect the treachery of Men: many Easterlings turned and fled, and Ulfang sons attacked the rear of Maedhros. The traitor's leader, Uldor, was slew by Maglor. The sons of Bór slew Ulfast and Ulwarth, ere they were slain. But Uldor had kept hidden a force of men in the eastern hills, and they attacked the host of Maedhros, which was now assailed from three sides, and it was broken and scattered.

All of Fëanor's sons were wounded, but escaped to the east to Mount Dolmed (Blue mountains) with a remnant of Noldor and dwarves. Azaghâl, Lord of Belegost, was killed by Glaurung. Fingon and Turgon were assailed by a force thrice greater than the force that was left to them. Turgon and Húring were pushed to the Fen of Serech by Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs, who attacked and killed Fingon.

Turgon retreated to Gondolin, through the Pass of Sirion, with his people and such of Fingon's people as could be gathered. Their flanks were guarded by captains Ecthelion and Glorfindel. The remnants of the house of Hador, leaded by Húrin and Huor, protected their retreat. Then, they retreated behind Rivil river, behind the Fen of Serech, to make their last stand. The sixth day, all of them died, save Húrin that was captured, as Morgoth commanded.

The realm of Fingon disappeared. The sons of Fëanor took a wild and woodland life beneath the feet of Ered Lindon, mingling with the Green-elves of Ossiriand. Some few Halading yet dwelt in Brethil leaded by Handir, son of Haldir. Morgoth sent the Easterlings that served him to Hithlum. Orcs and wolves went freely through all the north, and came ever further southward into Beleriand, even as far as Nan-tathren and the borders of Ossiriand. Doriath remained, and Nargothrond was hidden.

The next year, Morgoth sent great strength to Hithlum and Nevrast. Then, they went south, ravaged all the Falas, and besieged and destroyed Brithombar and Eglarest. The tower of Barad Nimras was cast down. And most Círdan's people were slain or enslaved. But some escaped by sea on a ship with Círdan and took refuge in the Isle of Balar, and even kept a foothold at the Mouths of Sirion, hidden in reeds and creeks. Turgon heard of this and sent messengers to ask Círdan to make ships to sail out into the West. Círdan built and sent seven ships, but no news of them came to Balar, save one ship that foundered in a storm near Nevrast.

Morgoth commanded the orcs to gather all the bodies, harness, and weapons of the fallen and pile them in a great mound in the midst of Anfauglith. It looked like a hill and was called Haudh-en-Nirnaeth (Hill of the Tears) by the elves.

- ~~Fëanor~~: **Maedhros**, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin, Amrod, Amras.
- ~~Fingolfin~~: ~~Fingon~~, **Turgon**, Aredhel.
- Finarfin: ~~Finrod~~, **Orodreth**, ~~Angrod~~, ~~Aegnor~~, Galadriel.


#### Túrin Turambar

Rían, wife of Huor, wedded him two months before he went to Nirnaeth Arnoediad. When no news came from him, she fled into the wild and gave birth to her son, Tuor, among the Grey-elves of Mithrim. Then, she departed to Haudh-en-Nirnaeth and died there. Morwen, wife of Húrin, stayed in Dor-lómin with his 8 years old son, Túrin. Then, the Easterlings came to Hithlum, despising the remnants of the people of Hador, oppressing them, taking their lands and goods, and enslaving their children. To protect his son, she sent Túrin with two servants to Doriath, and Túrin received him at Menegroth. Meanwhile, Morwen gave birth to Nienor, daughter of Húrin.

Túrin stayed in Menegroth for 9 years. Then, he joined the men-at-arms and went to battle on the marches of Doriath for 3 years. One day, a jealous king's counsellor waylaid him, but Túrin defeated and set him to run naked as a hunted beast through the woods. However, the counsellor fell into the chasm of a stream and died. Fearing to be held captive by Thingol, he escaped west of Sirion, beyond the Girdle of Melian, and joined a band of outlaws. However, Thingol pardoned him and asked him to return, but he decided to stay near Amon Rûdh.
